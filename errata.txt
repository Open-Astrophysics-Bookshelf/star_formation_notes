This is a list of errata in the print edition. The errors have been
corrected in the github repository version.

Chapter 2, various locations: class 1 instead of class I (when
referring to protostars), plus miscellaneous typos in text (reported
by G. Ejlali)

Chapter 6, equation 6.40: the inequality should be $\lesssim$ rather
than $\gtrsim$ (reported by J. Dalcanton)

Chapter 6, after equation 6.86: this should read "where $\mathbf{f}_g$
is the gravitational force per unit mass." (reported by J. Dalcanton)

Chapter 7, equation 7.12: the final unit should be erg s^-1 g^-1, not
erg g^-1.

Chapter 8, after equation 8.2: there are two equations between 8.2 and
8.3 that are not numbered, and should be; in addition, these two
equations are missing factors of g_0 and g_1, the degeneracies of the
states, respectively. Finally, in the sentence before the unnumbered
equations, "atoms in the level 0 and 1 states" should read "molecules
in the level 0 and 1 states".

Chapter 10, equation 10.42: the left hand side should read
exp(s_crit), not s_crit.

Chapter 12, equation 12.3: the second fraction on the right hand side
is inverted, i.e., the second term on the RHS should be
\int_{-\infty}^0 dt \dot{M}_*(t) / \int_{-t_{MS}(m)}^0 dt
\dot{M}_*(t). (reported by A. Ginsburg)

Chapter 13, equation 13.10: the final numerator should be rho L^3
rather than rho L^2.

Chapter 13, equation 13.17: the final term on the right hand side
should be 1/alpha_vir r nabla' psi, rather than 1/alpha_vir nabla' psi
as written.

Chapter 13: "viral" instead of "virial" (reported by G. Ejlali)

Chapter 14, above equation 14.2: the text "and the case theta = 1
corresponds" should read "and the case theta = 90^\circ corresponds"
